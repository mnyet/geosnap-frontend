# GeoSnap

This is my first full-stack application, and I'm currently working on it to improve my full-stack development skills.

GepSnap is a full-stack web application that allows users to share places with images and locations. Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB Express.js React.js Node.js) it enables users to create view update and delete locations while ensuring secure authentication and authorization.

**Please note that this project is still a work in progress, and I am currently working on the front-end development.**


## Tech Stack

**Front-end:** ReactJS, (React Router, FontAwesome icons, animations with React Transition Group)

**Back-end:** NodeJS, ExpressJS

**Database:** MongoDB (Mongoose ODM)

**Styling:** TailwindCSS

**Map & Geolocation:** Leaflet.js

**[The project is currently WIP]**
